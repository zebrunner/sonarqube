# SonarQube

SonarQube (formerly Sonar) is an open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities on 20+ programming languages. SonarQube offers reports on duplicated code, coding standards, unit tests, code coverage, code complexity, comments, bugs, and security vulnerabilities.
It can record metrics history and provides evolution graphs. Provides fully automated analysis and integration with Maven, Ant, Gradle, MSBuild and continuous integration tools (Atlassian Bamboo, Jenkins, Hudson, etc.).

Zebrunner SonarQube image is pre-configured SonarQube v7.9.3 with [community branch plugin](https://github.com/mc1arke/sonarqube-community-branch-plugin) installed for static code analysis.

It is fully integrated into the Zebrunner Community Edition Server pipeline for Test Automation code inspection and user's guidelines.
